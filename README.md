# Object Detection with JavaScript

This project aims to demonstrate how to perform object detection using JavaScript. It utilizes the TensorFlow.js library, which allows running pre-trained models directly in the browser.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kuldeepjambhulkar/ObjectDetectionJS.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ObjectDetectionJS`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run locally: `npm run dev`

## Prerequisite

- Since the object detection will be logged in browser's console, it is better to open the code & demo site in desktop/laptop
- You'll need a webcam/camera
